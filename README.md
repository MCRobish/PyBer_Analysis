# PyBer Fares by City Type 
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the trends of ride fares over time and compare the performance between urban, suburban and rural areas. The data provided includes information from January to May 2019. The population density required for each of the city classes would be helpful to understand the true differences between each of these city types, but the definition was outside of the scope of this project. 
## Results 
This analysis determined that there is a substantial difference in ride sharing data among different city types. The table below shows the differences in key rideshare data for Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas.

According to this data, there are fewer total rides and fewer total drivers in rural and suburban areas than in urban areas. This likely explains why the total fare revenue for urban areas is $39,854.38, which is significantly more than the suburban and rural areas. However, the average fare per ride and per driver is highest in the rural areas. This could be for a few different reasons. One main reason may be because of supply and demand principles. There are fewer drivers in rural areas, so the supply is lower
