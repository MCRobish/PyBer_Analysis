# PyBer Fares by City Type 
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the trends of ride fares over time and compare the performance between urban, suburban and rural areas. The data provided includes information from January to May 2019. The population density required for each of the city classes would be helpful to understand the true differences between each of these city types, but the definition was outside of the scope of this project. 
## Results 
This analysis determined that there is a substantial difference in ride sharing data among different city types. The table below shows the differences in key rideshare data for Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas.

According to this data, there are fewer total rides and fewer total drivers in rural and suburban areas than in urban areas. This likely explains why the total fare revenue for urban areas is $39,854.38, which is significantly more than the suburban and rural areas. However, the average fare per ride and per driver is highest in the rural areas. This could be for a few different reasons. 

* One main reason may be because of supply and demand principles. There are fewer drivers in rural areas, so the supply is lower. When there is lower supply, rideshare companies may increase pricing to try to recruit more drivers to meet demand. (1)

* Another potential contributor would be that because rural and suburban areas are less densely populated than urban areas, the trip distances may simply be longer. Longer trips would require more gas cost and more time from the drivers, which results in a higher fare per trip. 

This analysis also looked into the fare cost over time. For the four month period examined, the average fare for each city type is fairly stable. There is some short term volatility, but there is not an overall trend for increases or decreases. This shows that the urban areas are leading to the highest overall profit currently.

## Summary
Overall, it appears that the urban areas are contributing most to weekly profit in comparison to the suburban and rural areas. To have the largest impact to profit, it would be beneficial to continue expansion into any urban cities that PyBer has not yet reached. It would also be interesting to gather the ride mileage and a calculation of the "operating costs" (i.e. gas prices, insurance costs, accident rates) to better understand why the average fare per ride is higher in rural areas than in suburban and urban areas. If the goal is to futher increase the number of drivers in suburban and rural areas, it would make sense to consider increasing fare prices more to better cover operating costs in these areas. There could also be sign on bonuses and targeted advertising campaigns to potential drivers in those areas in order to attract more drivers.
